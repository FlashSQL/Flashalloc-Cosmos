# The include statement below is a temp one for tests that are yet to

--source include/force_myisam_default.inc

# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test calls CHANGE MASTER in order to check if replication can
# restart from where SQL thread left, not from where I/O thread left.
#
# This file tests the case when master_info is stored in a table (see
# the -master.opt file).
